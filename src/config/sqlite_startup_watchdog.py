"""Supervise the startup database check: stop it when it stalls, not when it is slow.

A wall-clock bound cannot tell a large database on slow storage from a scan
that is stuck, so it eventually stops healthy work. This watchdog runs the
check as a child process and watches what the child is actually doing: bytes
it has read (``rchar`` in ``/proc/<pid>/io``, which counts reads served from
the page cache too) and CPU time it has used (``/proc/<pid>/stat``). The check
is stopped only when neither has moved for ``STALL_SECONDS`` -- a read blocked
on a dead mount, a lock that never clears -- or when it passes a generous
absolute ceiling that exists only to end a runaway loop.

Where ``/proc`` cannot be read, the scan's own status sidecar is the progress
signal instead, and the ceiling still applies.

The sidecar lives next to the database, on the same storage that may be the
thing that stalled. Every sidecar read or write here therefore runs on a
helper thread with a short bound, so a dead mount can delay a heartbeat line
but never the stall decision.

Usage: ``python -m config.sqlite_startup_watchdog DB_FILE COMMAND [ARG...]``.
Exits with the child's status, or 124 when the watchdog stopped it, which is
the status ``timeout(1)`` used and the entrypoint already handles.
