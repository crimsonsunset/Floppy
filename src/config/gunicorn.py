# three hours, never recycled, because real traffic had not yet served 500
# requests. Celery already bounds its children by RSS; this is the same bound
# for the web worker, checked after the response so no request is ever failed
# by it.
# Sized from a measured fresh worker, not a guess: with preload_app one starts
# at 109-136 MiB RSS, because RSS counts the shared application image it was

    being shared.

    The cost is measured, not theoretical. Production's shared pages fell from
    76 MiB to 30 MiB over three hours, and the master's private memory rose by
    exactly what it lost -- the master never wrote those pages, but once a
    child had written its own copy the master's became exclusively mapped and
    was recounted as private. Every process converged on the same ~30 MiB,
    which is the part nothing ever touched. A local run reproduces it: 36.9
    MiB shared decaying to the same 30.6 MiB floor.

    Freezing moves everything alive now into a generation collection never
    visits, so those pages stay shared. Objects created afterwards are still
    collected normally. Children inherit the frozen state through fork, so
