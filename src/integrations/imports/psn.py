"""PlayStation Network importer for played games and hours played.

PSN exposes no clean purchase library, so "owned" is approximated by every
title the account has played (see :mod:`integrations.psn_api`). Hours played
come from ``title_stats``' cumulative play duration, which PSN reports for
every played title.

One game can appear under several title IDs -- the PS4 and PS5 releases, or
regional variants -- that all resolve to the same IGDB game, so matches are
aggregated by IGDB ID before anything is written: play durations add up,
the most recent last-played date wins.

PSN only reports lifetime totals, so each sync remembers the total it saw
(:class:`PlaytimeSnapshot`) and logs the difference as a new, dated play entry.
Existing entries are never edited. The first time a game is seen its total is
only remembered, plus -- when the account's setup choice asks for it -- written
as one entry spanning its first to last played dates.
