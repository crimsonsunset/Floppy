"""A Redis-set work queue for the metadata backfills.

Seven backfills (watch providers, genres, runtimes, episode runtimes, credits,
IGDB ratings, Trakt popularity) each kept their pending IDs as one pickled list
under a single cache key, and each enqueued by reading the whole list, unioning
into it, and writing the whole list back. That is O(N) bytes through Redis per
batch and O(N^2) per sweep, and since the reconcilers re-enqueued every
candidate every five minutes, the same multi-megabyte value was rewritten
continuously - which with ``--appendonly yes`` also meant continuous disk
writes (issue #521).

A Redis set does the same job in O(batch): ``SADD`` to enqueue, ``SPOP`` to take
work, and the deduplication the ``set().union()`` was there for comes free.

The second thing this fixes is a silent failure. Each copy wrapped its cache
work in ``try/except`` and fell back to dispatching the IDs directly. With
``IGNORE_EXCEPTIONS`` on the cache that ``except`` became unreachable -
``cache.set`` and ``cache.add`` return ``None`` instead of raising, the drain is
never scheduled, and the IDs are dropped with no error anywhere. Callers here
get an explicit "the queue is unavailable" answer instead of inferring it from
an exception that no longer arrives.
