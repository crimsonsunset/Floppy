"""Cheap, always-on attribution for Floppy's largest memory excursions.

Floppy's normal footprint is small; what is not yet bounded is its *high
water*. A container that settles under 800 MiB is not a "<1 GB application"
if a routine backup or one media-list request drives its cgroup to 5 GB, and
until now the only evidence of such an excursion was a Portainer graph that
had to be correlated against timestamps by hand.

This module makes an excursion attributable. It samples two envelopes at
request and task boundaries:

* the **application resident envelope** -- this process's RSS and its
  high-water RSS (``VmHWM``), which never falls and so records the peak even
  when the allocation has already been freed;
* the **operational cgroup envelope** -- everything charged to the container,
  including filesystem page cache, which is what separates "Python grew" from
  "a 2 GiB file was written through the page cache".

Both are read from ``/proc`` and cgroup v2 files -- no ``smaps`` walk, no PSS.
PSS costs a full VMA traversal per sample and stays where it belongs, in the
diagnostic sampler (``scripts/container_memory_sample.py``). What is here is
cheap enough to leave enabled in production, which is the point: the sample
that explains a 5 GB spike is the one that was already running when it
happened.

Nothing is logged for an ordinary request. A structured ``memory_high_water``
event is emitted only when a boundary crosses one of the thresholds in
``settings`` -- see ``_high_water_reasons``.
