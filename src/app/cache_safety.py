"""Tell "the lock is held" apart from "the cache is broken".

The cache is configured with ``IGNORE_EXCEPTIONS``, which is right for the
hundreds of read-through call sites: a backend failure and a miss mean the same
thing to a cache, so both should just fall through to the source of truth.

It is *wrong* for the ~20 places that use ``cache.add`` as a lock, because
``IGNORE_EXCEPTIONS`` turns a failure into ``None`` and ``if not cache.add(...)``
reads that as "someone else holds it". Whether that is safe depends entirely on
what the lock guards:

* A lock around **best-effort maintenance** should fail closed. Skipping a cache
  warm during a Redis outage costs nothing, and piling background work onto an
  already-struggling host costs plenty.
* A lock around **work the user asked for** must fail open. Silently refusing an
  import or dropping a scrobble because the cache was briefly unwell is data
  loss, and these paths all have their own downstream duplicate protection.

``cache_add`` exposes the three states so callers can say which they are, rather
than inheriting whichever behaviour falsiness happens to give them. The
tri-state shape is the one already used by ``discover/tab_cache._cache_add``;
this is that pattern made explicit and shared.
