# PlayStation Network sync

How `integrations/imports/psn.py` turns PSN's lifetime playtime into game entries.

## What PSN reports

Per title: lifetime play duration, first and last played time. Nothing per session, so Floppy
cannot know *when* within a sync window the time was played. PS4 and PS5 releases of one game
resolve to the same IGDB game and are summed before anything is written.

## How a game's time is logged

Each play of a game in Floppy is one `Game` row: start date, end date, minutes. History's
**Repeats** mode spreads a row's minutes evenly across its date range; **Sessions** mode shows
the row as one entry. Both read the same rows, so the importer only has to write sensible dates.

`PlaytimeSnapshot` remembers the lifetime total PSN gave at each sync. A sync then does, per game:

| Situation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Total grew since the last sync | One new row: start = previous sync, end = PSN's last played time (or now), minutes = the difference. Behaves like a scrobble. |
| Total unchanged, or lower | Nothing is logged. A lower total (a sibling title ID failed to match) never lowers the remembered one. |
| First time the game is seen, already tracked | Nothing is logged; the total becomes the starting point. Existing rows are never edited. |
| First time seen, not tracked, setup choice "Import it" | One row from first played to last played with the whole lifetime total. No dates from PSN means a dateless row, which History skips and statistics don't spread across a year. |
| First time seen, not tracked, "Only track new play" | Nothing is logged; the game appears with its first new play. |

The setup choice is labelled "Import Backlog and Scrobble New Data" (the default) or "Scrobble New Data
Only" and lives on `PSNAccount.import_existing_playtime`. "Only Sync New Items" and
"Sync New Items and Overwrite Existing" behave the same for PSN: a sync only adds rows, so there
is nothing to overwrite.

A game deleted in Floppy stays deleted; its snapshot still advances so the old time is not
logged later.

Two guards keep the remembered totals honest. Syncs for one user are serialized with a cache lock
(`_run_psn_import`), so Sync Now and the schedule can't both log the same growth, and the new rows
and the snapshots are saved in one transaction. Snapshots belong to one PSN account: they are
deleted on disconnect and when a different PSN account connects.

## When it syncs

There is no frequency setting. Connecting, or pressing Sync Now, runs a sync and keeps one
recurring task per user every `SYNC_EVERY_HOURS` (3) hours, at a minute derived from the user id
so users don't all hit PSN together (`_ensure_psn_schedule` in `integrations/views.py`). It also
replaces any older daily/2-day schedule a user chose before this. The 3 hours is a guess: we
have not measured how often PSN refreshes `title_stats`. Each sync only records the time a total
grew, so a shorter cadence would give a closer time of day; change the constant if PSN turns out to
update sooner. Titles PSN leaves uncategorised need a store lookup to tell games from apps, so
`psn_api._is_game` caches the answer (30 days) to keep frequent syncs cheap.

## The card

The PlayStation card builds its fields from `users/components/game_sync_fields.html`: a
"Syncs automatically every N hours" line, the playtime choice above, and a read-only "Game Logging"
line that shows the user's Repeats or Sessions style (`User.game_logging_style`). Each has its own
short tooltip (`users/components/info_tip.html`). Xbox and Steam should include the same
component when they move onto `PlaytimeSnapshot`, so every game source reads the same way.

## The result message

The task reports `created` (new rows) and `skipped` (unchanged games). Any created row also
triggers the History and Statistics cache refresh. Xbox and Steam report `updated` for the hours
they overwrite for the same reason.

## Not done yet

Xbox and Steam still overwrite lifetime hours on one row. Moving them onto
`PlaytimeSnapshot` (new dated entry per sync) is the same change.
