# What the test suite costs

The suite got slow enough that waiting on it became the bottleneck for both
people and agents. This records what was measured, what the causes actually
are, and what was changed.

All numbers below are from one cloud container: 4 CPUs, 16 GiB RAM, SQLite,
`--parallel` (so 4 workers), `--exclude-tag slow --exclude-tag network`.
6,115 tests across 420 test files.

## Headline

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| test-database setup, every run | 141 s | 141 s (2.8 s with `FLOPPY_TEST_FAST_DB=1`) |
| `app.tests.views.test_history` (35 tests), execution only | 53.6 s | 25.6 s |
| whole suite, one app at a time | — | 398 s with `FLOPPY_TEST_FAST_DB=1` |
| whole suite, single invocation | 21 min+, sometimes never finishes | **~20 min, deterministic** (runs serially) |

## Cause 1: 141 seconds of migrations before any test runs

`setup_databases()` takes 141 s, and 140.1 s of that is applying migrations —
422 of them. It is the same 141 s whether the run is `--parallel 1` or
`--parallel 4` (the migrate is serial; the workers then clone the result), and
the same 141 s for one targeted test as for the whole suite. That is the floor
under every single test command anyone runs.

Where it goes:

| app | migrations | time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| users | 121 | 88.8 s |
| app | 153 | 33.2 s |
| integrations | 50 | 10.7 s |
| everything else | 98 | 7.4 s |

`users` is two thirds of it for a third of the migrations. The reason is a
repeating pattern — seventeen migrations named
`users.NNNN_remove_user_tv_sort_valid_and_more`, each ~3.5 s:

```
RemoveConstraint x10   (tv_sort_valid, season_sort_valid, movie_sort_valid, ...)
AlterField       x10   (the matching *_sort CharField choices)
AddConstraint    x10
```

Every time a sort option was added to a choices list, `makemigrations`
regenerated the whole check-constraint set. On SQLite each of those ~30
operations rebuilds the entire `users_user` table, and `users_user` is wide.
The tables are empty — this is pure DDL overhead, thirty table rebuilds per
migration.

### What was done

`FLOPPY_TEST_FAST_DB=1` sets `MIGRATION_MODULES` to `None` for the first-party
apps, so the schema is created straight from the models: **141 s → 2.8 s**.

It is **opt-in, not the default**, for two honest reasons:

* it stops the suite exercising the migration graph at all, and
  `config.tests.test_migration_hygiene` fails under it (correctly — that test
  reads the migration graph, which is exactly what the flag skips);
* it skips `RunPython` data migrations, so anything depending on rows a
  migration creates would silently differ.

Use it while iterating. Do not use it as the final gate on a migration change,
and CI should not use it.

### The squash: attempted, measured, and deliberately not shipped

Squashing `users` is the obvious real fix, so it was tried rather than assumed.
What came back changes the recommendation.

`squashmigrations users 0044_merge_20251115_1520 0132_user_appearance` succeeds,
and the operation count is a genuine win:

| | operations |
| --- | --- |
| originals, 0044-0132 | 1,097 |
| squashed | 410 |

63% fewer operations means roughly 63% fewer `users_user` table rebuilds, so
most of the 88.8 s is recoverable. Two things stop it being a drive-by:

1. **Django's optimizer is defeated by the fork's own migration operations.**
   `AddFieldIfNotExists`, `AddConstraintIfNotExists` and
   `RemoveConstraintIfExists` are redefined *inline inside 21 separate
   migration files* rather than imported from one module. The optimizer sees
   21 unrelated classes, none of which implement `reduce()`, so it cannot
   collapse a `RemoveConstraintIfExists` against the matching
   `AddConstraintIfNotExists`. That is why 410 operations survive instead of
   something closer to the ~100 the final model state actually needs. Eleven
   `RunPython` operations act as further optimization barriers.

2. **31 RunPython functions need hand-porting** into the squashed file, which
   Django cannot do automatically. On a fresh install those data fixes run
   against empty tables and are no-ops, so most are probably `elidable`, but
   "probably" is not good enough for code that runs against real upgrade
   paths. Squashing across the 0038-0043 merge points is a further wrinkle:
   those numbers are duplicated by merge migrations, and `0038` contains a
   `lambda` that blocks serialization outright
   (`ValueError: Cannot serialize function: lambda`).

So: a squash is worth doing, it is worth roughly 50-55 s of every test run, and
it needs its own change with the maintainer reviewing the ported functions and
the upgrade matrix (`scripts/replay_upgrade_matrix.sh`) replayed. It is not
something to bolt onto an unrelated PR.

**The cheap prerequisite worth doing first:** move the idempotent operations
into one shared module (e.g. `users/migrations/_operations.py`) that new
migrations import, and give them `reduce()`. That does not touch a single
shipped migration's behaviour, and it means the *next* squash optimizes
properly instead of dragging 410 operations forward.

## Cause 2: password hashing, 42% of an auth-heavy module

Django's default `PBKDF2PasswordHasher` costs **296 ms per hash** on this
hardware. The suite has 631 `create_user`/`create_superuser` call sites, 210
`client.login(...)` calls (each of which verifies, another 296 ms), and 586
`setUp` methods against only 17 `setUpTestData` — so most of that cost is paid
per test method, not once per class.

Measured on `app.tests.views.test_history`: 72 encodes (21.8 s) + 35 verifies
(10.6 s) = **32.4 s of the 53.6 s** the module spent executing tests.

### What was done

`config/test_settings.py` now sets:

```python
PASSWORD_HASHERS = ["django.contrib.auth.hashers.MD5PasswordHasher"]
```

`app.tests.views.test_history` went from 53.6 s to 31.0 s of execution, a 42%
cut, with no test changes. Tests assert on authorization, never on hash
strength, and this is test settings only — production is untouched.

## Cause 2b: fixtures rebuilt for every test method

With hashing fixed, `setUp` was still **37% of what `app.tests.views.test_history`
spent executing tests** — 11.7 s of 31.7 s, rebuilding the same rows for every
test method. The suite has 586 `setUp` methods against 17 `setUpTestData`.

`setUpTestData` builds the fixture once per class inside a class-level atomic
block, and Django rolls each test method back to that state, so for a fixture
that is only *read* the two are equivalent. Django also wraps the attributes so
a test that mutates them does not leak into the next one.

Three classes in that module were converted:

| | setUp | module setUp share | module tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| before | 11.7 s | 37% | 53.6 s (31.0 s after MD5) |
| after | 2.7 s | 11% | **25.6 s** |

`HistoryMonthViewTests` alone went from 22.0 s to 15.0 s.

### The recipe

Not every `setUp` can move, and the split matters:

* **Moves to `setUpTestData`:** creating users, items and tracked media — rows
  the tests only read.
* **Stays in `setUp`:** `self.client.login(...)` (the test client is per-test),
  `cache.clear()`, and anything with a side effect outside the database, such as
  `history_cache.invalidate_history_cache(...)`.
* **`mock.patch` needs care.** `setUpTestData` is a classmethod with no
  `addCleanup`, so a fixture that must not hit providers starts the patches and
  stops them itself. `_begin_model_metadata_patches()` in
  `app/tests/views/test_history.py` is the shape to copy;
  `_start_model_metadata_patches(self)` stays in `setUp` for the test bodies.
* **`captureOnCommitCallbacks` is a classmethod**, so `cls.captureOnCommitCallbacks(...)`
  works in a class fixture — but on-commit callbacks behave differently inside
  the class-level atomic block, so check any fixture that depends on them.

Classes whose `setUp` mutates fixture objects or touches the cache were
deliberately left alone here. Audit before converting: the cheap filter is
whether the body does anything other than create rows.

The remaining 583 `setUp` methods are the same opportunity, module by module.
Convert the slowest first (`--durations` names them) and verify each module
against real migrations, not `FLOPPY_TEST_FAST_DB`.

## Cause 3: the parallel runner can lose results and hang forever

This is the one that actually strands a session, and it is not slowness — it
is a hang.

Reproduced with `app` and `integrations` in a single `--parallel` invocation
(each passes on its own: 159 s and 38 s). Instrumenting
`ParallelTestSuite.run_subsuite` and the parent's result loop:

```
PARENT_DISPATCH total_subsuites=659 processes=4
WORKER_START:      659
WORKER_DONE:       659        <- every subsuite finished
PARENT_RECEIVED:   565        <- 94 results never arrived
```

Every test ran to completion. All four workers were then idle in
`multiprocessing.queues.get()`, and the parent sat in `IMapIterator.next()`
waiting for results that never came. A `py-spy` dump of the parent showed
`_handle_workers` and `_handle_tasks` but **no `_handle_results` thread** — the
pool's result-handler thread was gone, which is why delivery stopped dead.

Ruled out:

* **not unpicklable results.** Pickling every result in the worker succeeded;
  the whole run's results total 188 KB, the largest 5.2 KB.
* **not a stuck test.** All 659 subsuites reported done.
* **not the `FLOPPY_TEST_FAST_DB` flag.** The first full-suite run in this
  session, with real migrations and no flag, also ran 21 minutes without
  producing output.
* **not the fork start method.** See below — it hangs under `spawn` too.

It is **intermittent** — a later identical run of `app integrations` passed
(659/659 received). That matches the reported experience of the GitHub run
taking "about 30 minutes, sometimes 40".

This is a race in the interaction between Django's parallel runner and
`multiprocessing.Pool`, not a Floppy bug in the ordinary sense, and fixing it
properly is its own investigation. What is not acceptable is that it hangs
silently.

### What was done

`scripts/test.sh` now wraps the runner in `timeout --kill-after=30s`, default
2700 s, tunable with `FLOPPY_TEST_TIMEOUT` (`0` disables). A lost-result hang
now fails loudly with a non-zero exit instead of never returning. CI already
has `timeout-minutes` on its jobs.

### `spawn` does not fix it

The leading theory was fork-related: workers forked from a parent that already
has pool threads can inherit a half-held queue lock, and corrupted bytes on the
result queue would kill the unpickling thread. `spawn` re-imports instead of
forking and cannot inherit a lock, so it was the obvious test.

`FLOPPY_TEST_START_METHOD=spawn`, `app integrations`, three attempts:

| attempt | result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | passed, 194 s |
| 2 | **hung** (killed at 900 s) |
| 3 | passed, 166 s |

So the hang survives `spawn`, and the fork theory is wrong. Worth noting that
spawn is not slower here, despite re-importing per worker.

It is also load-dependent: four consecutive `app integrations` runs on an
otherwise idle box all passed, while the hangs in this session all happened
when something else was competing for CPU. That is consistent with a timing
race and is why it resists a small reproduction.

### What is armed for next time

`config/test_settings.py` now calls `faulthandler.enable()` unconditionally,
and `FLOPPY_TEST_WATCHDOG=<seconds>` arms `faulthandler.dump_traceback_later`
so every thread's stack is dumped if a run outlives its budget.
`scripts/test.sh` sets that automatically to 120 s before
`FLOPPY_TEST_TIMEOUT`, so a hang now dumps its stacks *before* the timeout
kills it, with no one needing to remember a flag.

**CI cannot be wired up the same way from a pull request.** The
`check-workflow-changes` job fails any PR that touches `.github/workflows/**`,
by design. So arming the watchdog for CI -- which is where the hang is most
expensive, since the job just burns its 45 minutes and reports a timeout with
no evidence -- has to be done as a deliberate, separate workflow change by
someone who can land one. The one-line version is an `env:` entry on the
"Run Tests" step:

```yaml
      - name: Run Tests
        env:
          FLOPPY_TEST_WATCHDOG: "2400"
```

### Fixed: the suite runs serially, and survives parallel if you ask for it

There turned out to be **two** failures wearing the same costume, and only one
of them is a delivery race:

* On a *subset* of the suite (`app integrations`), results go missing at random
  and re-dispatching to a fresh pool recovers them — five runs out of five,
  clean.
* On the *whole* suite, the same subsuites go missing every time. Measured:
  **131 of 923 lost, and three fresh pools recovered only 2 of them.** Work
  that is lost deterministically is not a delivery race — the workers carrying
  it are dying, which is consistent with the SIGSEGV seen on CI. No amount of
  re-dispatching fixes that, and the run ends red after half an hour.

So `config/test_runner.py` (wired in via `TEST_RUNNER`) does two things:

**It runs serially by default.** With `parallel=1` Django builds a plain suite
and never touches `multiprocessing` at all — `DiscoverRunner.build_suite`
guards the entire parallel path on `parallel > 1`. No pool, no worker to lose,
nothing to hang on. Measured on the full suite with real migrations:

```
Ran 6127 tests in 1185.348s   (~20 min, no hang)
```

That is inside the 30–40 minutes this suite historically took, and the hashing
and fixture work above is part of why.

**It makes parallel survivable for anyone who opts in** with
`FLOPPY_TEST_PARALLEL=<n>`: completion is counted rather than inferred from
`StopIteration`, a stall re-dispatches the missing work to a fresh pool up to
`FLOPPY_TEST_MAX_DISPATCH_ATTEMPTS` times, and if that fails the run **fails
loudly and ends** rather than hanging or pretending the missing tests passed.

#### Three things that had to be learned the hard way

Each was a version of this runner that moved the hang instead of removing it,
and each is now pinned by a test in `config/tests/test_resilient_test_runner.py`:

1. **`pool.join()` on the healthy path.** Joining waits on the pool's handler
   threads; when one has died, that wait *is* the hang.
2. **`pool.terminate()` anywhere.** `_terminate_pool` calls
   `_help_stuff_finish`, which takes the task queue's `_rlock` — still held by
   the wedged task handler. Caught live with `py-spy`:
   `_help_stuff_finish (pool.py:675)` ← `_terminate_pool (pool.py:695)` ←
   `terminate (pool.py:657)`.
3. **The pool's atexit finalizer.** `Pool` registers `_terminate_pool` through
   `util.Finalize`, so multiprocessing's exit handler runs it on the way out —
   back into the same deadlock *after* the suite printed its results. A run
   reported "Ran 4302 tests" and then never exited.

#### Why recovery re-dispatches instead of running in the parent

The first working version ran the undelivered subsuites in the parent. It
completed the suite but produced `tearDownClass` errors —
`TransactionManagementError: The rollback flag doesn't work outside of an
'atomic' block` — because the parent spends the parallel phase orchestrating
and its connections never went through `_init_worker`. Adopting a worker's
connections with `setup_worker_connection` did not fix it either. The parent
is not a faithful environment, so that path was removed.

#### What serial execution exposed

Running everything in one process surfaced a latent isolation bug that
parallelism had been hiding: `app.tests.test_celery_broker` registers stand-in
Celery tasks under real route names, but `app.finalize()` replays every
`@shared_task` onto the new app, so the real `import_radarr_recurring` won the
name and failed its signature check. It only bites when `app` and
`integrations` tests share a process. Fixed by registering the stand-ins after
`finalize()`.

### Superseded: the earlier recovery-only design

`config/test_runner.py` (wired in via `TEST_RUNNER` in test settings) replaces
Django's collection loop. It does not fix the race — nobody has root-caused it
— it makes the race survivable:

* **Completion is counted**, not inferred from `StopIteration`.
* **Stalling is bounded.** If nothing arrives for `FLOPPY_TEST_STALL_TIMEOUT`
  seconds (default 300), the pool is abandoned and whatever never came back is
  **re-dispatched to a fresh pool**, up to `FLOPPY_TEST_MAX_DISPATCH_ATTEMPTS`
  times (default 5). Only the missing subsuites are retried, so a successful
  retry is quick.
* **Teardown touches neither `pool.join()` nor `pool.terminate()`** — both can
  block forever on a pool in this state. Workers are killed directly and the
  pool's atexit finalizer is cancelled.
* **If every attempt fails**, the run *fails loudly and ends*. It never hangs,
  and it never reports missing tests as passing.

Measured on the `app integrations` combination that reproduces the race, five
consecutive runs:

| run | result | stalls | errors | duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | pass | yes, recovered on attempt 4 | 0 | 462 s |
| 2-5 | pass | none | 0 | ~141 s |

Before this, the same combination hung outright.

#### Three things that had to be learned the hard way

Each of these was a version of the runner that moved the hang rather than
removing it, and each is now pinned by a test:

1. **`pool.join()` on the healthy path.** Joining waits on the pool's handler
   threads; when one has died, that wait *is* the hang.
2. **`pool.terminate()` anywhere.** `_terminate_pool` calls
   `_help_stuff_finish`, which takes the task queue's `_rlock` — still held by
   the wedged task handler. Observed blocking forever:
   `_help_stuff_finish (pool.py:675)` ← `_terminate_pool (pool.py:695)` ←
   `terminate (pool.py:657)`.
3. **The pool's atexit finalizer.** `Pool` registers `_terminate_pool` through
   `util.Finalize`, so multiprocessing's exit handler runs it on the way out —
   back into the same deadlock *after* the suite has printed its results. A
   recovered run reported "Ran 4302 tests" and then never exited. Cancelling
   the finalizer is what lets the process die.

#### Why recovery re-dispatches instead of running in the parent

The first working version ran the undelivered subsuites in the parent process.
It completed the suite, but produced `tearDownClass` errors —
`TransactionManagementError: The rollback flag doesn't work outside of an
'atomic' block` — because the parent spends the parallel phase orchestrating
and its connections never went through `_init_worker`. Adopting a worker's
connections via `setup_worker_connection` did not fix it either. A fresh pool
is a faithful environment and the parent is not, so recovery retries pools and
the in-process path was removed entirely.

### CPython confirms the dead result handler

An attempt to mitigate this (a `TEST_RUNNER` that stops waiting after a stall
and re-runs the missing subsuites in-process) was built, tested and then
**reverted** — but it produced the best evidence so far. On detecting the
stall it called `pool.terminate()`, which raised:

```
AssertionError: Cannot have cache with result_handler not alive
```

That is `multiprocessing.pool._terminate_pool` asserting that a pool with
outstanding results in its cache must still have a live `_result_handler`
thread. It does not. So the py-spy reading is now confirmed by CPython's own
invariant: **results are outstanding and the thread that would deliver them is
dead.** That is the bug, stated precisely.

That mitigation was briefly reverted when a second reproduction appeared to
show the stall branch never firing. `py-spy` on the live hang showed the
opposite: the stall *was* detected, and the process was then stuck inside
`pool.terminate()`. That is finding 2 above, and the runner described earlier
is the result of fixing it.

### What should be done next

* Root-cause what kills `_handle_results`. The runner survives the symptom;
  it does not explain it. A `parallel_runner_stalled` line in a CI log is the
  signal that it is still happening.
* A segfault (`selectors.py`, exit 139) was seen once, right after a watchdog
  dump. `selectors` is what `multiprocessing.connection.wait()` uses, which is
  where `_handle_results` sits — suggestive, but seen once and not confirmed.
* Try a smaller `--parallel` worker count and see whether the rate changes;
  that would confirm the timing-race reading.
* Until then, treat a suite run that produces no output well past its usual
  wall time as this bug, not as a slow test.

## How to run tests quickly now

```bash
# Iterating on non-migration code — the fast path.
FLOPPY_TEST_FAST_DB=1 SECRET=test-only scripts/test.sh app.tests.test_statistics_sync

# The real gate: real migrations, real graph.
SECRET=test-only scripts/test.sh app.tests.test_statistics_sync

# Whole fast suite.
SECRET=test-only scripts/test.sh

# Tests the current diff can reach. Still pays the migration floor
# unless FLOPPY_TEST_FAST_DB=1 is set.
SECRET=test-only scripts/test.sh --affected
```

## Tests for the diff in front of you

`scripts/test.sh --affected` is the local iteration path when you do not
want to type a label. The change set is every commit since the merge-base
with `origin/latest`, plus staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

A changed test module runs. A changed source module runs the test modules
that import it, including a name re-exported from a package `__init__.py`.
The walk is not transitive: `from app.models import Movie` selects tests
when `media.py` changes, and does not select them when some other model
file changes. If nothing imports the file and it sits under one app, that
app runs. Modules loaded by string from `AppConfig.ready()` (`app.signals`,
`app.signals_watch_state`, `app.signals_music`, `integrations.signals_state`,
`users.signals`) run the app, because a static importer list is the wrong
set. Music hook files under `MUSIC_HOOKS_DIR` run `app`.

`src/templates/`, `src/static/`, `uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, settings, and
the runner (`scripts/test.sh`, `src/config/test_runner.py`,
`src/config/affected_tests.py`, and the other paths in
`ESCAPE_HATCH`) run the fast suite. Docs and other non-code run nothing.
`mcp_server/` and `scripts/tests/` are named and do not escalate: the Django
suite does not collect them.

The run excludes `@tag("network")` and does not exclude `@tag("slow")`, so
a slow test you changed still runs. CI is unchanged, and so is
`scripts/test.sh` with no arguments.

Running apps one at a time (`app`, then `users`, …) both avoids the
lost-result hang seen so far and gives usable per-app timings:

| app | tests | time (fast DB) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| app | 2,880 | 153 s |
| api | 715 | 142 s |
| integrations | 1,422 | 33 s |
| lists | 268 | 11 s |
| events | 174 | 10 s |
| config | 245 | 10 s |
| users | 411 | 6 s |

## Pre-existing failure worth knowing about

`config.tests.test_container_memory_sample.ReconciliationTests.test_complete_sample_reports_totals_as_reconciled`
fails in this container with and without any change here: it reads real
`/proc` PSS and finds one process without `smaps_rollup`
(`rss_only_processes` is 1, not 0). It is environment-dependent, not a
regression.
